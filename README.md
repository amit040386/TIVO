## Quick start: How to run this template

First clone project and install dependencies

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/amit040386/TIVO.git
$ cd TIVO
$ npm install
```

Then install Redis in local if not installed

```sh
$ sudo brew install redis
$ sudo brew services start redis (It should display: Successfully started redis)
$ redis-server (Command to check whether redis server is running or not)
```

Then run local

```sh
$ npm run start
```

Default port number is 7009
Localhost URL: http://localhost:7009/user

**NOTE**: To change the port, create a .env in root folder and add your port number as follows.

```javascript
PORT=4566
```

or change the port number in this file: server/util/port.js

**NOTE**: If any new locale texts are added, please re-execute the npm start command

**NOTE**: If you want to check whether all redis keys have been created or not, please execute these commands.

```sh
$ redis-cli
$ EXISTS REDIS_TIVO_CUSTOMER_INFO
```
If it returns 1 then it is confirmed that the key has been created successfully. Otherwise it would return 0. For more details, please go through this [documentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/redis/redis_keys.htm). 

## Unit Testing

Use the following commands to execute the test cases

```sh
$ npm run test
```

# Scope of improvements

- NodeJS architecture is not created
- Test case setup is done but test cases are not written. A few basic test cases have been written for two atomic components (LoadingIndicator and Message). Rigorous test cases yet to be written.
- Production deployment setup for Redis, is not created
- Complete theme setup is not done but created the scope
- Multiple languages are not added
